<p>- Data Analytics Service Providers</p>

<p>- Cloud Computing Service Providers</p>
<p>- Communication &amp; Collaboration Tools</p>
<p>- Performance Monitoring Tools</p>
<p>- Product Engineering &amp; Design Tools</p>

<p>- Testing Tools</p>
<p>- Website Hosting Service Providers</p>
<p><strong>7. Use Cookies And Other Tracking Technologies?</strong></p>
<p>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies. Rather, we utilise anonymous page view tracking information provided by third-party analytics providers which do not collect or store any personal data. As such, we make no use of cookies.</p>
<p><strong>8. Transfer of Information to Other Jurisdictions</strong></p>
<p>Aelf operates and engages service providers in various jurisdictions. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. By using our Website, you acknowledge and agree to such transfers and processing, including to and in the United States. We will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>
<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable laws.</p>
<p>- European Commission’s Standard Contractual ClauseWe have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>
<p><strong>9. Duration of Storage of Information</strong></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Privacy Policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p><strong>10. Maintaining security of the Information</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we collect and process.</p>
<p>However, please remember:</p>
<p>- Despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, unfortunately no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>
<p>- Transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>
<p>- You are responsible for your username and password and should keep them safe.</p>
<p>- If you believe your privacy has been breached, please contact us immediately <a href="https://form.aelf.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11. Your Rights and Choices</strong></p>
<p>In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right to :</p>
<p>- Request access and obtain a copy of your personal information.</p>
<p>- Request rectification or erasure.</p>
<p>- Restrict the processing of your personal information and, if applicable, to data portability.</p>
<p>- In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p>- If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p><strong>12. Controls For Do-not-track Features</strong></p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>13. Changes To This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
<p><strong>14. Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, you may email us <a href="https://form.aelf.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>15. How Can You Review, Update, Or Delete The Data We Collect From You?</strong></p>
