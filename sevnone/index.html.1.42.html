<p><strong>13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong></p>
<p><strong>13.1. Agreement to Arbitration.</strong> You and aelf both understand and agree that any claim or dispute arising under these Terms of Use or your relationship with aelf (past, present, or future) will be finally settled exclusively by binding arbitration in accordance with the United Nation’s UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (at <a href="https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/arbitration/contractualtexts/arbitration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/arbitration/contractualtexts/arbitration</a>), which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.</p>
<p><strong>13.2. Pre-Arbitration Procedures.</strong> You and aelf mutually agree to attempt to resolve all disputes using good-faith and strive for a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (a “Dispute Notice”). Any Dispute Notice to aelf must be sent <a href="https://form.aelf.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and any Dispute Notice we send to you will be sent to the email address registered with your account or otherwise associated with your use of the Site and agreement to these Terms and Conditions. Dispute Notices must include each of the following: (a) the contact details of the party providing the Dispute Notice; (b) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (c) an explanation of the specific relief sought, including the total damages sought, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations; (d) a signed statement from the party providing the Dispute Notice verifying the accuracy of its contents; and (e) if the dispute is from you and you have retained an attorney, then a signed statement from you authorising aelf to disclose your account details to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim or dispute. If an agreement is not reached to resolve a claim within 60 days after a notice of demand is received, then either party may commence an arbitration proceeding; except that, if either you or aelf send the other an incomplete Dispute Notice, the 60-day period begins tolling only after a complete Dispute Notice is received. Additionally, if either you or aelf request a telephone discussion, the 60-day period begins tolling only after the discussion has occurred. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in required informal dispute resolution procedures.</p>
<p><strong>13.3. Arbitration Procedures.</strong> Should any dispute proceed to arbitration, you and aelf expressly agree that an arbitrator properly appointed under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules may issue all appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief necessary to ensure the arbitration and final settlement of disputes (but only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim). You and aelf agree to keep any arbitration strictly confidential. The properly appointed arbitrator will have the authority to order any remedies, legal or equitable, that a party could obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction in an individual case based on the claims asserted, and nothing more.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div><footer
